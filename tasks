1. Implement ML examples in spark 
  Ex: Titanic with all classification algorithms
  Ex: House Sale Price predictions with all regression algorithms
  
2. Deep Learning 
   1. identify major algorithms in Deep Learning
      CNN, RNN, FFNN...
      High level overview which algoritm for what purpose
      1. NLP(audio)
         Find algorithms needed for audio analysis
         NLP Audio
         Flow chart Request=>(conversion audio to text(unstructured) to structured to db)
         Flow chart Response=>(conversion Structured text to text(unstructured) to audio or text assist)
      2. NLP(unstuctured text)
         Find algorithms needed for text analysis
         NLP Text
