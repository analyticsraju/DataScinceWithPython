1. Implement ML examples in spark 
  Ex: Titanic with all classification algorithms
  Ex: House Sale Price predictions with all regression algorithms
  
2. Deep Learning 
   1. identify major algorithms in Deep Learning
      CNN, RNN, FFNN...
      High level overview which algoritm for what purpose
      1. DL With NLP(audio)
         Find algorithms needed for audio analysis
         NLP Audio
         Flow chart Request=>(conversion audio to text(unstructured) to structured to db)
         Flow chart Response=>(conversion Structured text to text(unstructured) to audio or text assist)
         
      2. DL with NLP(unstuctured text)
         Find algorithms needed for text analysis
         NLP Text
         Flow chart Request=>(conversion text(unstructured) to structured to db)
         Flow chart Response=>(conversion Structured text to text(unstructured) to text assist)
         
         
      3. DL With Computer vission(Image and video Processing)
         Find algorithms for Image processing
         Flow
         
         Find algorithms for Video processing
         Flow
